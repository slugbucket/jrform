JRFORM
======

Some ancient PHP of mine from 2004/5 to provide a simple message board for a
school.
It was based around an idea of using an XML description of the forms on the site
and binding the forms and elements to database queries and columns with an
emphasis on teh form lifecycle and sensible re-display in the event of an error.
This was prior to any exposure I had to formal design patterns or any kind of
framework.
It is included for its curiosity value only.
