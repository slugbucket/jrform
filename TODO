Current version: 20 April 2005
 - Support multiple select forms in all their horrific glory.
 - input/select object choose which db query to use
 - Add support for textareas
 - GET/POST data to be merged with the form object via a separate method to
   showForm.
28 April 2005. This is done in the main jrform code although the form attrs
   array is still processed by the showForm method.
 - Complete form attribute support
 - Verify operation of Form methods after an input object has been removed.
28 April 2005
 - Implement action to be taken when a db query returns no data.
The nodata XML attribute can have the value 'break' to skip creation of the
   form if no rows are returned by the query.
1 May 2005
 - Implement method for defining pre- and post-form element markup outside
   form/input/dropdown tags and also be able to choose from also support a
   default pre and post attribute so the same piece of markup can be used for
   multiple elements.
   Given the partial template support below, this might not be needed.
 - Add a Form::showElement() method to allow display of a particular element
   rather than the clumsy approach using showForm().
4 May 2005
 - Allow XML database queries by breaking down the query into individual parts
   with separate entities for each select item, each table and each where
   clause with a 'src' attribute to allow picking a value from a form
   submission. This will only support simple queries because we do not want
   to build a SQL parser; the use of strings in the driver code is preferred.
 - Allow lists of database query list to be specified in the XML file.

Additions
---------
 - Added Form object support for addressing form elements by name as well as
   numerical index.
1 May 2005
 - Partial template support added so that the markup for the form can be kept in
   a template fileand the form elements displayed with PHP calls such as:
<?php echo $forms[user]->showForm( "head" );
echo $forms[user]->showForm( "userid" );    ?>
and
<tr>
 <td>Full Name</td><td><?php echo $forms[user]->showForm( "fname" ); ?></td>
</tr>
The template technique can be used to decide whether to display a form or not
if the database query has not returned any rows, or, one of different forms
based on submitted criteria.

Major functions to be added in later versions:
 - Namespace support to allow multiple forms on one page that use the same
   form element names but use different data
 - URL grabber to take a page layout and extract the form details form it and
   build an XML description (as part of admin interface).
 - Add PHP session support.
 - Have a web interface define the query in the XML file so that arbitrary
   form data can be inserted into the query at runtime.
 - Add facility to auto-create form items based on repeat criteria - useful for
   wizard type forms where a form submission results in re-display of the
   form with an additional item similar to other items.
